# YOLOV8_optimization_DeepX_NPU-
Designed and implemented optimization pipelines for YOLOv8 to enable high-performance deployment on DeepX Neural Processing Units (NPUs). Applied techniques such as pruning, quantization, and computational graph optimization to reduce latency, memory footprint, and MACs while maintaining detection accuracy.
